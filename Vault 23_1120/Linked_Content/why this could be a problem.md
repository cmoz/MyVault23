The speed discrepancy between the CPU and RAM has been a long-standing issue in computer architecture. In general, CPUs can process data much faster than RAM can provide it, creating a bottleneck that hampers overall system performance. 

This is often referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck.

Here's a simple analogy: Imagine a fast reader (CPU) and a slow page-turner (RAM). The reader can read a page very quickly, but has to wait for the page-turner to turn to the next page. Thus, the overall speed of reading the book is hampered by the speed of the page-turner.

This speed discrepancy becomes a problem because it means that the CPU is often idle, waiting for data to process. This wait time can significantly reduce the performance of a computer system, particularly for data-intensive applications.

Computer systems have developed a few strategies to mitigate this problem:

1. **Caching**: This is the most common solution. Cache is a small amount of very fast memory located on or close to the CPU. Data that is accessed frequently (or that the system predicts will be accessed frequently) is stored in the cache. This way, the CPU can access this data quickly, without having to wait for the RAM.

2. **Prefetching**: This is a technique where the system predicts what data will be needed in the future and fetches it from RAM to cache in advance. This is often done while the CPU is idle, effectively utilizing this otherwise wasted time.

3. **Multithreading**: This technique allows the CPU to switch to another task (thread) when it has to wait for data from RAM. This way, the CPU can keep working while waiting for the data for one task, thereby improving overall system performance.

4. **Memory hierarchy**: Modern systems use a hierarchical structure of memory, with multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, L3), main memory (RAM), and even disk storage. Each level in the hierarchy is slower but larger than the one above it. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

5. **DRAM innovations**: Techniques like interleaving (accessing data from multiple RAM modules to exploit their parallelism), and use of faster DRAM types (like DDR4, DDR5) help in reducing the speed gap.

While these strategies have been quite effective, the speed discrepancy between the CPU and RAM continues to be a challenging issue, especially given the increasing demand for data-intensive applications. As a result, research into new memory technologies and data handling strategies is a crucial aspect of computer science.
