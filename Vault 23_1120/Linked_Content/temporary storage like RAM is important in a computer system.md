Temporary storage like Random Access Memory (RAM) is crucial in a computer system for several reasons:

1. **Speed**: RAM is significantly faster than other storage media like hard drives or SSDs. It provides a fast-access area where the CPU can store and retrieve data quickly. This helps in speeding up the processing of data and the execution of programs.

2. **Volatile Nature**: The data stored in RAM is temporary (it's lost when the computer is switched off or restarted), which makes it suitable for storing transient data that's only required for the duration of the current session, or the execution of a particular task or program.

3. **Running Applications**: All the currently running applications and system processes use RAM to store instructions, user data, and any other information that needs to be readily available. Without sufficient RAM, your system would have to constantly fetch this data from slower storage, causing significant performance degradation.

4. **Multitasking**: RAM enables multitasking on your computer. When you're running multiple applications simultaneously, each application reserves a portion of RAM for its operations. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can run concurrently without impacting performance.

5. **Caching**: Some frequently used data or recently accessed information is stored in RAM for quicker access. This is a form of caching which improves the overall system performance.

6. **Buffering**: RAM is used as a buffer in many input/output operations. For instance, when you're streaming a video online, a portion of the video is downloaded and stored in RAM for seamless playback.

7. **Virtual Memory**: When the physical RAM is full, the system uses a portion of the hard disk as 'virtual memory.' This area acts like RAM, swapping data in and out as needed. While this is slower than using RAM, it allows the system to handle larger workloads.

In essence, RAM serves as a bridge between the super-fast but small CPU cache, and the slower but larger secondary storage. Without RAM, the CPU would have to interact more with the slow secondary storage, significantly reducing the computer's speed and performance.
