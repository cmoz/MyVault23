look at CODE book to start with the 'story' of 'gates' 
this is on / off
early other boolean systems, morse code, telegraph, flash light for chatting with your friend, braille embossed or not embossed etc leads to chapter 8 .... relays and gates
Also boolean architecture - counting classes of objects e.g. counting a class of cats - white cats, and brown cats, but not black cats....
