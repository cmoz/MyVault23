1.  "IEEE 754 Floating Point Representation" by Michael L. Overton ([http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall07/G22.3033-007/lecnotes/lecture2/node5.html](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall07/G22.3033-007/lecnotes/lecture2/node5.html)) - This website provides a detailed explanation of the IEEE 754 floating point representation format. The article includes examples of how to convert numbers from binary to decimal and vice versa. (Broken link)
2.  "IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter" by Systematic Sweeper ([https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html)) - This website provides a tool to convert decimal numbers to their IEEE 754 binary representation and vice versa. The tool is easy to use and includes instructions on how to use it.
3.  "Floating Point Arithmetic" by William Kahan ([https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF)) - This document is written by the inventor of the IEEE 754 floating point standard, William Kahan. It provides an in-depth explanation of the standard and its history. The document is quite technical but provides a wealth of information for those interested in the subject. (A bit much for 1120)
