Floating-point numbers are crucial for representing real numbers in computer systems and are a fundamental part of most programming languages. 

**Introduction (5 minutes):**

- Brief overview of the session's content.
- Define floating-point numbers and why they are needed in computer systems.

**Fundamentals of Floating-Point Numbers (10 minutes):**

- Discuss the concept of real numbers and how floating-point numbers allow us to approximate them.
- Explain the components of a floating-point number: sign, exponent, and mantissa (also called significand or fraction).

**Representation of Floating-Point Numbers (15 minutes):**

- Discuss the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which is widely adopted in computer systems.
- Break down the structure of single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) floating-point numbers according to the IEEE 754 standard.
- Show examples of floating-point numbers in binary form.

**Floating-Point Arithmetic (10 minutes):**

- Discuss how basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are performed with floating-point numbers.
- Highlight the issue of rounding errors and precision loss in floating-point arithmetic.

**Floating-Point Numbers in Programming (10 minutes):**

- Show examples of how floating-point numbers are used in common programming languages, such as Python, Java, or C++.
- Discuss common pitfalls when working with floating-point numbers in programming, such as comparing for equality.

**Practical Exercise (5 minutes):**

- Provide students with some simple programming problems that require the use of floating-point numbers, such as calculating the area of a circle given its radius or finding the roots of a quadratic equation.

**Conclusion and Questions (5 minutes):**

- Summarize the key points from the lecture.
- Open the floor for questions and discussion.
- Provide resources for further learning.
