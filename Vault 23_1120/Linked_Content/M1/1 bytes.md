**Introduction (5 minutes):**

- Begin with an overview of what you will be covering during the session.
- Define what a byte is: A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits. It's the most common unit of data in computing.

**Basics of Binary and Bits (15 minutes):**

- Explain the concept of binary numbers, a base-2 system, which is the language of computers. Talk about how binary digits (0 and 1) are the basic data unit in computing.
- Introduce the concept of a 'bit', which is a binary digit, the smallest unit of data in a computer.
- Show examples of binary numbers, and demonstrate how they can be used to represent different types of data (numbers, letters, etc.)

**From Bits to Bytes (15 minutes):**

- Explain how 8 bits come together to form a byte. Discuss why this grouping is useful for representing larger sets of data.
- Show how bytes can represent different data types, from numbers to characters in a string, to colors in a pixel, and so on.
- Give examples of byte-sized binary and how to convert them to decimal and ASCII characters.

**Bytes in Computer Memory (15 minutes):**

- Explain how bytes are used to store data in computer memory.
- Discuss the addressable memory concept, with each byte or group of bytes in memory having a unique address.
- Discuss memory size terminology, such as kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes.

**Practical Applications and Activities (5 minutes):**

- Show examples of how understanding bytes is useful in practice, such as in estimating storage needs, understanding file sizes, network speeds (bits/bytes per second), etc.
- Suggest an activity, such as working with a hexadecimal editor to view and modify the bytes in a simple text file.

**Summary and Questions (5 minutes):**

- Summarize the key points from the session.
- Ask some questions to assess students' understanding and stimulate discussion.
- Provide resources for further learning and encourage students to explore more about bytes and binary system.

Here are some discussion points and questions to consider when teaching about bytes:

1. **Discussion Points:**
   - The History of Bytes: Discuss why a byte is composed of 8 bits, and not any other number. You can talk about the historical and technical reasons for this choice.
   - The Impact of Bytes on Storage: Discuss how the concept of bytes influences the size and cost of storage devices.
   - Real-World Examples: Discuss where students encounter bytes in their daily lives, such as when downloading files, streaming videos, or buying a new computer or smartphone.

2. **Questions:**
   - Why do you think the byte has become the fundamental unit of data storage, rather than the bit?
   - How many different values can one byte represent? How about 2 bytes? 3 bytes?
   - How does changing one bit in a byte affect the overall information that byte represents?
   - If you were sending a message using bytes, how would you encode the characters?
   - How does understanding bytes help when you are programming or debugging software?
   - How does knowledge of bytes and memory management relate to performance and optimization in programming?

Absolutely, here are some sample questions that correspond to the points in the lecture:

**1. Basics of Binary and Bits:**
   - Can you explain how binary representation differs from our normal decimal number system?
   - How many unique values can one bit represent? Why?

**2. From Bits to Bytes:**
   - Why do you think we group bits into bytes? 
   - Can you give an example of a byte-sized binary value and explain what it represents in decimal and ASCII?

**3. Bytes in Computer Memory:**
   - How do bytes correspond to data storage in computer memory?
   - If you have a computer with 8GB of RAM, roughly how many bytes is that? 

**4. Practical Applications and Activities:**
   - If you have a 5MB text file, about how many characters could it contain?
   - How might understanding bytes and binary be useful when working with network data?

These questions aim to promote understanding and critical thinking, reinforcing the information provided in the lecture. They could be used during the lecture to engage the students, or afterwards as a form of review or assessment. Remember, it's essential to adjust the complexity and depth of the questions based on the students' level of understanding.
