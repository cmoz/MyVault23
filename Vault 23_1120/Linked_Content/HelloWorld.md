# C code documentation
You may find this code in this folder in a file called `HelloWorld.c` . 

* `#include <stdio.h>`: This is a preprocessor command that tells the C compiler to include the stdio.h file before going to the actual compilation.
* `int main()`: The main function is the entry point of any C program. The int keyword indicates that the function should return an integer type value.
* `printf("Hello, World!\n")`: This statement is used to print the "Hello, World!" on the screen. printf is a library function to send formatted output to the screen. In this case, it will print "Hello, World!".
* `return 0;`: This statement is the "Exit status" of the program. In simple terms, the program ends with this statement. A zero in this statement is a general convention indicating that the program has successfully completed.
* `{ and }`: These brackets enclose the body of the main function.

# How to compile and run
You can compile this program using the `gcc` compiler from a terminal (like bash on Linux, Terminal on macOS, or Command Prompt on Windows if you have gcc installed) with the following command:

> `gcc -o helloworld helloworld.c`

Here's what it means:

-   `gcc`: This is the name of the compiler - GNU Compiler Collection.    
-   `-o helloworld`: This option tells `gcc` to create an output file named "helloworld". You can choose a different name if you like.    
-   `helloworld.c`: This is the name of the source file that you are compiling.   

Assuming the `helloworld.c` file is in the current directory and contains the "Hello, World!" program, this command will produce an executable file named `helloworld` in the same directory.

Then you can run the program with the following command:

> `./helloworld`

And it should print `Hello, World!` to the console.

# Anatomy of an executable file

You may look into an executable file by having it printed to screen as a sequence of bytes using the hexadecimal number system:

> `xxd -C helloworld`

An executable file contains the machine code that a computer can execute directly, but it's more than just that machine code. It's structured in a way that the operating system understands how to load and run the code, along with additional necessary resources such as constants, variables, and libraries.

The exact structure of an executable file can vary between different operating systems, but generally, it contains sections like these:

1.  **Header**: Contains metadata about the executable like its size, the architecture it's compiled for (x86, ARM, etc.), the entry point of the program (where the program starts executing), and more.
    
2.  **Text segment (Code segment)**: This contains the actual executable code (instructions/machine code) of the program.
    
3.  **Data segment**: This contains the global and static variables initialized by the programmer.
    
4.  **BSS (Block Started by Symbol) segment**: This contains uninitialized global and static variables. BSS just allocates space for the variables. No actual disk space is used for uninitialized variables.
    
5.  **ROData (Read-Only Data) segment**: This contains constants and string literals.
    
6.  **Import/Export tables**: These contain information about functions and variables imported from libraries or exported to other programs. These tables help in dynamically linking libraries at runtime.
    
7.  **Relocation and Debug information**: The relocation section is used to handle pointers and references that may change when a program is loaded at a different memory location than it was linked for. Debug information, if present, is typically in a separate section and is used by debuggers to associate machine instructions with source code lines, variable names, type information, etc.
    
Note: The terminology may vary between different operating systems or executable formats. For instance, on Linux, the standard executable format is ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), while on Windows, it's PE (Portable Executable). The macOS uses the Mach-O format for its native executables. The overall principles are similar, but the specifics vary.
