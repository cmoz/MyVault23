If a computer didn't have any Random Access Memory (RAM), it simply wouldn't work. Here's why:

1. **Loading Operating System**: When a computer starts up, it needs to load the operating system into RAM. If there's no RAM, there's nowhere for the operating system to load into, so the computer wouldn't be able to start.

2. **Running Applications**: Whenever you run an application, the computer loads that application's data and executable code into RAM. Without RAM, you wouldn't be able to open or run any software.

3. **Processing Data**: The CPU uses RAM as a workspace for doing its calculations. If there's no RAM, the CPU has no place to do its work.

In essence, without RAM, a computer would not be functional because it wouldn't have any workspace to perform its tasks. Even with plentiful storage space on a hard drive or SSD, and an excellent CPU, a computer cannot operate without some amount of RAM to serve as a temporary, high-speed storage medium for active processes.

While it's technically possible to design a system to use only non-volatile memory (like a hard drive or SSD) instead of RAM, it would be impractically slow due to the much higher latency and lower speed of these types of storage compared to RAM. Modern computing relies on the existence of a fast, temporary storage medium like RAM to function efficiently.
