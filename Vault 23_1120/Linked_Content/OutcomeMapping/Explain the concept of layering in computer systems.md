Explain the concept of layering in computer systems and apply it to examples of systems in computer organization, programming languages, operating systems, and networks.

The concept of layering in computer systems is used to organize the different components of a system into layers that interact with each other ¹. Each layer provides a specific set of services to the layer above it and uses the services provided by the layer below it ¹.

The most common example of layering in computer systems is the OSI model ⁴. The OSI model is a seven-layer model that describes how data is transmitted over a network ⁴. Each layer in the OSI model provides a specific set of services to the layer above it and uses the services provided by the layer below it ⁴.

Another example of layering in computer systems is the layered architecture in software development ³. In this architecture, the system is divided into layers, with each layer providing a specific set of services to the layer above it and using the services provided by the layer below it ³.
