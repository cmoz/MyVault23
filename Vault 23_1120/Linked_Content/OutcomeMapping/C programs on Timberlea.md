ssh login into [timberlea.cs.dal.ca](http://timberlea.cs.dal.ca/) – Windows: you can use the program PuTTY – other options available; e.g., MobaXterm – On Mac: open a Terminal and type: ssh `<your csid>@timberlea.cs.dal.ca` where instead of <your csid> you should use your own CSID – On Linux: similarly to Mac, you open the terminal and type the same command: `ssh <your csid>@timberlea.cs.dal.ca`

You can now try to login to the timberlea server provided by the Dal FCS computing environment. Your own computer may be a Windows machine, a Mac, or a Linux. You need to use the ssh secure protocol to login to timberlea and on each of these environment you may need a different application to login.
