1. Explain how a block component of a CPU, such as an ALU, works.
    
2. Describe the components and functions of the CPU at the block level.
    
3. Trace machine execution through a modern computer architecture from instructions in assembly language.
    
4. Trace the execution of software from C statements to machine instructions with control flow
    
5. Explain pointers from the perspective of both C and machine level.
    
6. Explain the build process for C programs: compile, assemble, link.

When a program is executed by a computer, it goes through different levels of execution (1,2). The different levels are:

- Gate-level: This is the lowest level of execution where the program is executed using logic gates ⁴.
- Block-level: This level of execution involves the use of blocks of code that perform specific functions ¹.
- Machine-level: This level of execution involves the use of machine code or machine language which is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) ²⁵.
- Language-level: This level of execution involves the use of high-level programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, Perl, C#, JavaScript, etc. ³.
