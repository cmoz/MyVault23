In C, control structures are used to control the flow of execution of the program. These structures include loops, conditionals, and case statements. [In assembly language, the only control structures are progression (move to the next statement), unconditional jump (jump to address A), and conditional jump (if R==0 then jump to A) **1](https://bing.com/search?q=control+structures+in+C+assembly)[2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~jcf/classes/CSCI-GA.2110-001/slides/session3/ControlStructures-LoopsConditionalsAndCaseStatements.pdf)**.

The C language constructs are translated into assembly language constructs using these control structures. [For example, an if statement in C is translated into a conditional jump in assembly language](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_Languages/Introduction_To_MIPS_Assembly_Language_Programming_%28Kann%29/07%3A_Assembly_Language_Program_Control_Structures)
