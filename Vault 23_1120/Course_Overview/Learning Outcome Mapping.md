[[Low-Level Learning Outcomes]]

## Module 0 - Layering and basic UNIX skills
Duration: 2 lectures, 1 short lab to introduce technology platforms

	1. Explain the concept of layering in computer systems and apply it to examples of systems in computer organization, programming languages, operating systems, and networks.

*This module is shorter than the others and provides a high-level mental map for the rest of the term and an introduction to the UNIX environment.*

## Module 1 - Data representation
Duration: 5 lectures, 1 lab overview

	2.  Interpret the value represented by a binary string given a data representation format.
	3.  Convert between different number representations (dec, binary, hex, 2sC, and IEEE-754).
	4.  Use simple C programs to interpret data.

## Module 2 - Architecture and components
	5.  Explain how a block component of a CPU, such as an ALU, works.
	6.  Describe the components and functions of the CPU at the block level.

## Module 3 - Execution Fundamentals
	7. Trace machine execution through a modern computer architecture from instructions in assembly language.
	8. Trace the execution of software from C statements to machine instructions with control flow

## Module 4 - Memory 
	9.    Explain pointers from the perspective of both C and machine level.
	10.   Explain the build process for C programs: compile, assemble, link.

## Labs - System-level tools competencies
*This module runs concurently with other modules*

	11.   Use a unix-based system to manipulate directories and files, and execute commands to complete simple tasks
	12.   Create, transfer, and edit files  in a unix system
	13.   Use tools (such as gcc, gdb, and objdump) on a unix system) to compile and examine execution of code, and interpret data files.
	14.   Use a modern system to build, disassemble, run, and trace programs.
