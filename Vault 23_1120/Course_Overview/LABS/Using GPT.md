## Caveat
GPT can be used as a tutor for on-demand topics. You must be aware of the following:

* GPT-4 is much better but is not a free tool. 
* All prompt you enter into GPT becomes OpenAI's intellectual property, and this you cannot submit other people's intellectual property as prompts. Write your own. 
* GPT may offer explanations that are either incorrect or more complex than they need to be: consider the instruction provided in this course to be authoritative and instruction provided by GPT to be a _use at your own risk_. Your course instructor and TAs are not taking on the duties to correct erroneous output from GPT or any other language models.
* If you ask GPT to do your work, you are wasting your time since you must pass the Module 0 part of the final in order to include lab grades into the final grade calculation. Use as you see useful to **learn**. 
* GPT does not attempt to comply with legislation. 

There will be a space on Brightspace so students can share:
- things that GPT write that are incorrect, and why
- prompts to generate practice problems
- prompts that generates useful explanations and tutorials
