# Assessment scheme 
## Breakdown
For 4 modules, include 4 tests and a 4-part final accounting for 80% of the final grade. 20% of the final grade goes to lab activities. Each module (1 to 4) test is paired with with a part of the final and each student must pass with 60% at least one of the element of the pair to pass the course. 

## Absence for tests
Missed module tests are deferred to the final examination. The corresponding final section is worth 20% instead of 10% and must be passed.

## Labs
Lab grade are participation grades unlocked with passing the lab assessment part of the final examination.  Labs are checked out of the course git repository. Answers to lab are included in a file that must be pushed back on time for the deadline. Students should commit and push as often as after answering each question.
