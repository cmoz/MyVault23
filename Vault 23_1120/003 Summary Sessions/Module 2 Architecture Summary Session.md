Main topics covered in the sessions for Module 2 were:

- Ram Registers
- Gates and Logic
- Multiplexer, Combinational, Sequential Circuits
- ALU
- Alu Mem trace


---
Plan exercises and discussions around:

**Introduction (5 minutes):**

- Briefly discuss the purpose of the recap session.
- Provide an overview of the topics that will be covered.

**RAM Registers (10 minutes):**

- Revisit the concept of RAM and registers in a computer architecture.
- Discuss their roles in the fetch-decode-execute cycle using a simplified example.
- Ask a couple of review questions to gauge understanding.

**Gates and Logic (10 minutes):**

- Recap the fundamental logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and their truth tables.
- Discuss how these gates are the building blocks of digital circuits.
- Engage students with a quick practical problem (e.g., designing a simple logic circuit).

**Multiplexer, Combinational and Sequential Circuits (10 minutes):**

- Briefly revisit the concepts of a multiplexer, and the difference between combinational and sequential circuits.
- Discuss an example of where each is used in a computer system.
- Ask students a couple of questions to check understanding.

**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) (10 minutes):**

- Recap the role of the ALU in a CPU.
- Discuss its function with a simple example of an ALU operation.
- Ask a couple of questions to verify students' understanding.

**ALU Mem Trace (10 minutes):**

- Recap how tracing of memory operations in an ALU is performed.
- Discuss why this is important for understanding a program's execution.
- Engage students in a quick activity: present a simple memory operation and ask them to trace it.

**Conclusion and Open Questions (5 minutes):**

- Summarize the key points from the recap session.
- Ask students if they have any questions from the previous sessions.
- Discuss where these concepts fit in the broader context of computer science and why they're important.

Hopefully this session will refresh the memory of the students about these topics, clarify any doubts, and help them see the interconnections between the different topics.
