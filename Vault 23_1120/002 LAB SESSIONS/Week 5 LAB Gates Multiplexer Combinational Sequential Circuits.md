**Title of the Lab Session**: Interactive Exploration of Gates, Multiplexer, and Combinational & Sequential Circuits

**Duration**: 1.5 hours

**Lab Outline**

**I. Introduction and Overview (10 minutes)**

- Greeting and quick recap of the lecture content related to gates, multiplexer, and combinational & sequential circuits. (5 minutes)
- Brief overview of the lab session objectives and what you'll be doing. (5 minutes)

**II. Warm-up Exercise: Truth Tables (15 minutes)**

- Students will complete truth tables for basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR). This is to ensure that they understand the basic logic gates before moving on to more complex circuits. (10 minutes)
- Discussion and correction of the truth tables. (5 minutes)

**III. Activity 1: Building and Testing Basic Gates (15 minutes)**

- Students will use a digital logic simulator (like Logisim) to construct basic logic gates and test their behavior against the truth tables they just completed. (10 minutes)
- You should discuss the outcomes and any discrepancies that arise. (5 minutes)

**IV. Activity 2: Constructing a Multiplexer (20 minutes)**

- Students will construct a 4-to-1 multiplexer in the logic simulator using basic gates. They will then use different inputs to test its functionality. (15 minutes)
- Discuss the results and the role of a multiplexer in selecting input. (5 minutes)

**V. Activity 3: Creating a Combinational Circuit (20 minutes)**

- Students will design and build a simple combinational circuit, such as a half adder or full adder, using the digital logic simulator. They should test their circuit with different inputs to confirm that it works as expected. (15 minutes)
- Discuss the results and the practical uses of combinational circuits like adders in a computer system. (5 minutes)

**VI. Activity 4: Designing a Sequential Circuit (20 minutes)**

- Students will design and build a simple sequential circuit, such as a D flip-flop or a basic counter, using the digital logic simulator. They should test their circuit with different inputs to confirm that it works as expected. (15 minutes)
- Discuss the results and the importance of sequential circuits in computer memory and data storage. (5 minutes)

**VII. Conclusion and Q&A (10 minutes)**

- Recap of the lab session and review the key learnings of each activity. (5 minutes)
- Open the floor for questions and final discussions. (5 minutes)
