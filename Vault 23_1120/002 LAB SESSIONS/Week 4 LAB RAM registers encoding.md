**1. Simulation Exercises**

One of the best ways to understand how RAM and registers work is by using a simulator. You can use computer architecture simulators like MARIE, Little Man Computer (LMC), or a similar tool that visualizes how data is moved and processed within a computer. Students can write simple programs, load them into the simulator, and watch how the data moves between RAM and registers.

**2. Binary Number System**

Understanding the binary number system and how data is encoded in binary is essential. Exercises can include converting decimal numbers to binary and vice versa, binary addition and subtraction, or even understanding how binary is used to encode different types of data, like text (ASCII or Unicode) and colors (RGB values).

**3. Assembly Language Programming**

Although modern high-level programming languages don't require the programmer to manage registers directly, assembly language programming can provide valuable insights into how the CPU interacts with registers. Simple exercises in assembly language can give students a sense of how the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions. 

**4. Memory Management**

Provide exercises where students have to manually manage memory, like allocating and deallocating memory in a low-level language like C. This can illustrate the concept of memory addresses, as well as the distinction between stack and heap memory.

**5. Mini Quizzes or Tests**

At the end of the lab session, provide a quick quiz or test to evaluate their understanding of the topics covered during the session. It can include theoretical questions about RAM and registers, or practical problems like writing or deciphering simple assembly language instructions.

Remember to provide students with clear instructions and guide them throughout the exercises. The aim is not just to get them to complete the tasks, but to understand what they're doing and why. Encourage them to ask questions and discuss problems with their peers. Hands-on lab work can greatly enhance understanding and retention of these concepts.
